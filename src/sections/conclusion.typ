= Conclusion <section_conclusion>

- While LLava-Med achieves strong results with an 8B model, our model falls short of state-of-the-art performance. However, despite using less than 1/4th of the total parameters, we achieve significantly better-than-random performance. This validates our first key contribution, demonstrating that smaller models, when trained effectively, can still exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in radiological visual question answering.

- we successfully present a complete framework from sourcing and curating their own dataset to finetuning and evaluating models for radiological visual question answering.

- Our diagnostic tool successfully identifies typical group of examples that frequently lead to poor generations, such as chest images.
